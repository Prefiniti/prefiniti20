<p align="center"><font size="5">My friends and family are pretty much everything 
  I could ask for.<br>
  There are some hard times with the both of them, but we get through them.<br>
  I have tons of friends, but there are only a few that I can truly trust and 
  know that will be there.<br>
  My family can be a pain in my butt, but I do care for them a lot.<br>
  </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="7"><strong>Friends:</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><br>
  <strong><font size="6">Marisa:</font></strong><br>
  I have to say that my best friend is Marisa.<br>
  I've only known her for about the last 5 years.<br>
  We've had classes before, and we just grew a friendship of common interests.<br>
  We have a lot in common and I think that's why we can relate to each other.<br>
  We have the same musical interests and basically the same friends.<br>
  I'll never forget all the things that we have done together and growing up.<br>
  Both of us cause a lot of trouble when were together and we don't care.<br>
  I know that I can ask her for advice and she would help me as much as possible.<br>
  And she knows that she can do the same thing with me and I'd help her out.<br>
  After 9th grade, we lost connection for a bit because of school, but now<br>
  we have classes together again and we are more of best friends than ever.<br>
  I don't know what I would do without her, and her advice.<br>
  <br>
  </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong><font size="6">Michael:</font></strong><br>
  Even though Michael and myself are going out at the moment, I do consider him 
  a best friend.<br>
  Before we started going out, we had this little group of people we used to hang 
  out with.<br>
  Before we knew it, a lot of those people faded and we just started hanging out 
  more.<br>
  We have tons in common and we like to make each other laugh, not matter the 
  situation.<br>
  A lot of random things come in to play with this kid and he keeps me interested<br>
  on what the future might bring and what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.<br>
  I'm really glad that we have the relationship we have now.<br>
  I have tons of memories with him and I would never change that.<br>
  We're the freaks and we're okay with that.<br>
  It has been quite an experience.<br>
  <br>
  </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong><font size="7">Family:</font></strong><br>
  <br>
  Even though I said that I pretty much hated my family at times,<br>
  there are some really good times that I wouldn't change for the world either.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><br>
  <font size="6"><strong>My Grandmother:</strong></font><br>
  </font><font size="5">I don't think I would ever be able to get along with my 
  entire family without my late grandmother.<br>
  My real fathers' mother was the glue of the family and she tried to keep everything 
  in order.<br>
  I defiantly think that I've learned the most from her. She would sit with all 
  her grandchildren,<br>
  and just talk to them as if they were adults. That's what I loved about her, 
  I felt older.</font><font size="5"><br>
  I feel like there are a lot of things that I wouldn't be able to get through 
  without the thought<br>
  of her just talking things out. When she passed, I felt as if I lost a little 
  bit of myself.<br>
  I lost some wisdom and courage, but knowing that her sprit is still around makes 
  me feel better.<br>
  She really taught me that it's okay to be who you want to be, no matter who 
  you want to be.<br>
  <font size="6"><strong><br>
  My Mother:</strong></font><br>
  Even though my mother could be a real pain sometimes, I know that she is just 
  being the motherly figure that she intended to be to her children. She is looking 
  out for my best interests but she<br>
  really just needs to learn how not to be so uptight about some things.<br>
  She does a lot for me and I pay her back in return with helping around the house 
  and taking favors.<br>
  My mother can be very opinionative, which gets really annoying and we fight 
  a lot because of it.<br>
  But I do have to say, that I love my mother, because I wouldn't be here if it 
  wasn't for her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><br>
  <strong><font size="6">My Step Father:<br>
  </font></strong><font size="6"> <font size="5">I'm defiantly glad that I have 
  such a great stepfather. My real parents divorced when I was just about 
  </font></font></font><font size="5"><font size="6"><font size="5"> 1 &amp; 1\2 
  years old. Usually you hear about the kids who get into a battle divorce <br>
  with their  
  parents because of the step-parent, but that's not what I have.<br>
  I do have to say that I didn't like him at first, but I've grown to like him 
  a lot. <br>
  It was always a battle between us because we're both headstrong and independent, 
  but now</font></font></font><br>
  <font size="5">I actually talk to him more about things then I do with my mother, 
  I feel like I can relate more to him.
  We have common interests and we even think alike sometimes. It's scary..<br>
  <br>
  <strong><font size="6">My Sister:</font></strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5">My sister is the only one that I really get along with in my family. We have equalities that we have that really cause this.
