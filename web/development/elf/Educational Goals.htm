<p align="center"><font size="5">I plan to go to <em><strong><a href="http://www.pct.edu/">Pennsylvania 
  College of Technology</a></strong></em> to major in Graphic Design and minor 
  in Photography. Penn Tech, for short, is located in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. 
  Graphic design has always been one of my favorite things to do, even though 
  at the time, I didn't even know that I could end up doing it for the rest of 
  my life. Photography has always been there for me, my grandmother was always 
  taking pictures of nature as a hobby and she taught me how to use elements of 
  shadows, lighting and etc. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5">I visited Penn Tech in October just to start 
  touring colleges and Penn Tech was for me. Just the small classes and the one 
  on one time with the teachers that I experienced showed me that it was the school 
  for me. I enjoy the Graphics department very much, I could pretty much do anything 
  I please as long as I stay with the classes. There are different electives that 
  I could take to further my education and learn more in my field. Penn Tech just 
  seems like the best school in the area for my field of education. The small 
  college town of Williamsport seems like the place that I wouldn't mind staying 
  in for a while. It's not really a big city, but just a larger rural area that 
  I could defiantly find myself in for many years and won't get sick of.<br>
