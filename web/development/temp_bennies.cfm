<p>The way Prefiniti works is over the Internet. This means that having connectivity is important for your  business to take full advantage of all the features Prefiniti has to offer. This <strong>doesn't</strong> mean that you can't start using our services now. Your business may already use Internet-connected devices as a part of its day-to-day workflow, such as: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Text messaging capable mobile phones </li>
  <li>Desktop computers with an Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p>Your business may already have other Internet-connected devices in addition to those listed above. These devices are quite cost effective and have the ability to give you an Internet connection from virtually any location: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Wireless Internet cards provided by mobile phone providers</li>
  <li>Laptop computers for you or your crew chiefs to use in the field </li>
</ul>
<p>We want to help you figure out what you would need in order to make your company a Prefiniti-friendly company. If your company takes a fraction of the money it might otherwise have spent on expanding its office space, and invests it in  Internet-connected devices such as those listed above, the potential of Prefiniti will be fully realized, resulting in increased productivity and decreased costs.</p>

<p>In the next couple of steps, we'll prove to you how inexpensive this process is. We will show you how a small increase in your company's prices will pay for Prefiniti entirely over two years. After that--and we believe before--your company could be doing the same amount of business it is doing today, while saving more money. Even if you don't choose to raise your prices, think of how much you would save in fuel costs alone if your crews didn't have to go to an office building for lineouts or paperwork. We are here to help you make more money, not just save it. Your crews will be spending more time in the field and less time talking to you in the office or on the phone. That  translates into more profit with less overhead. </p>
