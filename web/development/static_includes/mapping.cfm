<strong>Mapping</strong><br /><br />
Prefiniti gives you two different types of mapping.  The first is our integration of the Google Maps API.  This tool is seamlessly integrated across Prefiniti.  It is available to all users on both the Business and Personal/customer users.  You and your employees get all the power of Google Maps right from your schedules, projects and profiles.  All of these views give you directions from any of the locations saved in your profile to the destination.  These maps have aerial photography, step-by-step driving directions that give you the time of travel and distance to your destination.  We have also created or own file type "Prefiniti Field Notes" that can be posted to a project from any GPS enabled data collector and be read by Google Maps.  This means that a crew chief can post the data in the field and be in an instant conversation with you or the customer while you are both looking at the area in Google Maps.  Our other mapping feature allows you to post PDF scans of local survey maps (Subdivision plats, etc) in an application that allows your crews and office personnel to always have access to these maps for extended use.  Think of it as your companies personal GIS.  You can search for these maps right from Google Maps or by map name.  No more going between multiple browsers and applications to get the data you need.  It's all in one place... Prefiniti.
