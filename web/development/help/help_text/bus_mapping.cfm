<h3 class="stdHeader">Mapping and directions whenever and wherever you need them</h3>

<p>Any place on Prefiniti that refers to a project's location  has Google Maps integrated into the framework for ease of use. And for  multiple-site projects, employees can use mapping within the Prefiniti  framework to get directions from location to location, without ever leaving the  Prefiniti network. Prefiniti makes it easy for your employees to get where they  need to go. <br /> <img src="/graphics/mapping.jpg" width="550" height="450" /></p>
