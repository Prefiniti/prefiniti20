<h3 class="stdHeader">Instant and automated employee notifications</h3>

<p>Optimized communication within your company is one of Prefiniti's priorities. One way Prefiniti does this is through its employee notification function. Based on personal preferences, employees can be notified by email or text to a mobile device. No need to hunt your employees down to remind them to submit daily timesheets. No more worrying about which deadlines are approaching or past and informing the responsible employees. And no need to track down employees when you assign them to a new task. Prefiniti does all these things for you. You can also receive notifications when a customer is past due on an invoice, when you receive a new message to your site mail, or when a new customer order is placed. This minimizes the amount of time you need to spend periodically checking your computer. When someone is trying to communicate with you, Prefiniti lets you know. Easy, convenient, efficient.</p>
