<h3 class="stdHeader">Advertising by word-of-mouth via the internet</h3>
<p>At Prefiniti we believe that when a company does a good job providing a good or service, people should know about it. Personal users have an account that utilizes many of the features of a typical social networking site - email, photos, space for leaving comments. But Prefiniti takes social networking a step further by using it as a business-referral system. When a customer does business with you, your business name is automatically associated with that user's account. The user is then able to rate their experience of doing business with you. If a customer is happy with your services, all of that customer's friends are going to know. People don't like to choose which companies to do business with randomly. They prefer to use companies that their friends also use and trust. And when they are looking for a company within your industry to do business with, they'll be more likely to pick yours. So with Prefiniti, it doesn't matter how much money you have in your budget to spend on advertising. What matters is the quality of your service. And with all the time you'll be saving by utilizing the many features that Prefiniti offers, you'll have plenty of time to focus on quality. And that, after all, is what business should be about. <br /><img src="/graphics/find_companies.jpg" width="550" height="450" /></p>
