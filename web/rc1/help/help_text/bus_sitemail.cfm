<h3 class="stdHeader">Convenient and reliable site email</h3>

<p>When you enroll your business in a Prefiniti account, you and each of your employees will have a site email account. The biggest advantage with this feature is that everything you need is all in one place, under the same network. Need to send a project file to a customer? Don't waste your time downloading the file to your computer, opening your email program, attaching the file, and waiting for large files to send. All project files are already stored within the site file storage area. All you need to do is write the email, associate that file with the recipient's account, and the file is "sent" instantaneously. What makes this speed possible is the fact that you are not actually sending the file through cyberspace, you are simply associating another user with the file so they can have access to it. And unlike regular email, there is no limit to file size that you can send to other users. As long as the file is uploaded to your site files, any user can "receive" the file in an instant with an easy click of the mouse. <br /> <img src="/graphics/site_mail.jpg" width="550" height="450" /> </p>
