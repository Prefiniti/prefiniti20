<h3 class="stdHeader">Your one-stop shop for project management</h3>

<p>Once a customer places an order, it becomes a project in the Prefiniti system with a series of tasks required for completion that are assigned to various departments. Prefiniti's project function makes it easy for you to view all of the information pertinent to a particular project, including files that are associated with the project, employee task assignment, timesheets relevant to the project, and maps and driving directions to physical locations pertaining to the project. Prefiniti becomes a central hub for employees and managers to view information and statistics relevant to any  project in which they are involved. Changes and updates are instant and access is easy. No need for your employees to come back to the office for updates. A laptop with an Internet connection is all they'll need to have the most current information. And with everything you need all in one place, efficiency is the name of the game. And  at Prefiniti, efficiency is what we're all about. <br /> <img src="/graphics/priority_projects.jpg" width="550" height="450" /></p>
