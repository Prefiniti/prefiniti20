<h3 class="stdHeader">Advertising with a local business emphasis</h3>

<p>Prefiniti is dedicated to providing services in a way that supports local industries. Most online search engines give advertising preference and an unfair advantage to businesses that have the biggest pocketbooks. At Prefiniti we believe this is a disservice to both small businesses and customers. The Prefiniti system gives small businesses a chance to compete with the giants by granting advertising preference based solely on location.  When your business subscribes to the Prefiniti network, it is automatically placed in the appropriate industry. Personal users then search by industry within their zip code, giving them the ability to easily locate the businesses that are close to them, and giving your business affordable access to local markets via the internet. And once a customer has found you, everything they need to do business with you from beginning to end is contained entirely within the network. Convenient for them, affordable for you. Prefiniti makes it happen.</p>
