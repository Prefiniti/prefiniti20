<strong>Scheduling</strong><br /><br />
Prefiniti gives you the ability to schedule yourself and your departments (crews) all from one interface with the power of de-conflict.  That means you'll never schedule a person or a crew in the same time frame.  Prefiniti's powerful scheduling is very easy to use.  Simply double click the start time of an even and the details pop up for you to edit.  Scheduling uses Prefiniti's notification system to send reminders for events and let crew or department members know when an event is created for them.  No need to call and let your personnel know about what they've been scheduled for.  They'll know about it sooner than you can dial their number.  And when you or you employees log in they see right on the home page what their schedule is for the day.  Scheduled events are tied into the mapping system so you can get to your appointments on time by knowing how to get there and how long it will take.
