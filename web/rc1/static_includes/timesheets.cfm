<strong>Timesheets</strong><br /><br />
Prefiniti is an online business management tool.  And timesheets are part of it's arsenal.  Now you can enjoy the benefits of having all of your employee's timesheets in one central location, accessible anywhere with an internet connection.  Now you can be in the field and answer clients important questions with a click of the mouse.  View all timesheets for a particular project right from the project or from the timesheet tool bar.  You can also say goodbye to all those endless hours reviewing timesheets before payday, because when an employee signs a timesheet you are instantly notified and can approve it right then and there.  The timesheet bottleneck is eliminated.  And you can have your reviewing hours back that you used to spend looking over the seemingly endless stack of paper.  Reviewing a timesheet closer to when it is submitted by your employees means that if you have a question about their timesheet it will be fresh in their memory instead of a distant recollection.  Prefiniti's timesheet feature allows you to build custom task code databases with attached rates or units.  So billing becomes quick and efficient.
