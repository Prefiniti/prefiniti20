<strong>Departments</strong><br /><br />
Small firms and large firms alike can benefit from the ability to create unique departments.  In your typical survey firm, for example, you can have all of your field crews identified by unique department names and schedule an entire crew or just a single employee inside that crew.  You can have one employee be a member of several different departments.  So if you have a crew chief that is also part of company management he would be part of his field crew and part of the management department.  You can view all department members schedules side by side, this helps you see if any members might, for example, be scheduled for a unique task, or be on vacation.  Another feature of departments is that they don't have to pertain to employees.  You can create a department for scheduling a conference room, or to schedule the use of certain computers.  The possibilities are only expanded by using Prefiniti's department feature.
