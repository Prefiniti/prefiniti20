<strong>Project Management</strong><br /><br />
Prefiniti offers its business users the unique ability to manage all of their projects through a single web based interface accessible anywhere with an Internet connection.  All projects are tied into our notification system so you don't have to remember to give your clients and employees useful reminders.  You can schedule any of your company's crews right from the project view by clicking dispatch crew, and those crews will have the powerful use of our integrated Google Maps to get directions from anywhere to the project to which they are dispatched.  One of the most powerful features of Prefiniti's unique content management system is it's ability to associate a file from one project to another, so when you are doing a re-survey of a lot you had previously surveyed, you can associate that original survey from the original project to the new project in one step.  No paper, no mess, and your crews can operate without coming into the office.
