<h3 class="stdHeader">Fast and efficient timesheet processing</h3>

<p>Prefiniti strips away the hassle of spending hours or days at the end of every pay period processing timesheets. With Prefiniti's timesheet system, employees fill out timesheets within the Prefiniti site using  task codes that are customized by you, the business owner. Once an employee digitally signs a timesheet, it moves immediately to management. If approved by management, the timesheet moves to accounting. Both management and accounting  have the ability to approve the timesheets or reverse them for editing back to the employee. Every employee is able to view the timesheets that he or she has submitted. Timesheets are processed quickly as they come in with the click of the mouse. No more piles of paperwork to process. No more hours of lost time reviewing every timesheet accumulated over a pay period. Prefiniti gives you your time back so that you can use it on increasing profits and growing your business. <br /> <img src="/graphics/time_sheet.jpg" width="550" height="450" /></p>
