This icon set is an implementation of many 3d icons directly produced from mentalrey (me) and Os-K icon set, 
the target is to have many icons whth glass/metal effect (not too much photorealistic). 
Normally I prefer to use icons from 72 to 128 pixel, I hope you like it.

99% of this set is GPL now and what's not is most likely creative commons 
(a tiny number of the mime types may be proprietary). 
PLEASE abide by the licence rules, if you use icons from this set please research and credit 
the appropriate people. I have been given permission to release other peoples art work under 
the GPL so respect the licence.

Enjoy ")
